# Tests

A quick note on what types of tests this exist, and what they focus on.

1. **Unit** : In the classical proper mature professional sense, purely unit level unit tests. No leakage, no creeping. F.I.R.S.T. tests, isolated, mocked, stubbed.
2. **User** : These tests focus on how the main program of the repo is to be used.
